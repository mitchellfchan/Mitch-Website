<p>What are YOUR goals/motives for this collection? * Create an important cultural hub for the city * Create a cultural identity for the development (branding?) * Create a valuable art collection that appreciates in value? * Attract a specific permanent tenant demographic, or attract tourists and visitors? * Add value to the surrounding buildings? * Build a collection of historical significance? * Is the public art a component intended to complement the development (e.g. Basically everything), or is it a main draw (e.g. Millennium Park, Storm King Art Centre)</p>

<h2 id="rolling-out-public-artwork-during-development-and-construction-phase">Rolling Out Public Artwork During Development and Construction Phase</h2>
<p>It will be a long time before VMC is finished, but we want to get use art to draw people to the site <em>now</em>. We want to start branding the site as a cultural hub; we want to start making our connections with the art community. Typically, the public art is the last thing that you bring onto a construction site. But I expect that most of the units in this development are going to be sold pre-construction, and so if the art is going to increase the value of the development, you need to show art pre-construction. How do we start our art programming ASAP, taking on temporary projects at a lower cost?</p>
<ul>
<li>Public spaces for performative work
<ul>
<li>This should be done early so that we can document it, probably make an exhibition about it even before the development is close to done. Start building goodwill and connections to art community.</li>
<li>Those naked public pictures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Possible Pavillion for indoor work?
<ul>
<li>could under-construction or not-yet occupied buildings provide temporary &quot;pop-up&quot; gallery spaces?</li>

<h2 id="curatorial-vision">Curatorial Vision</h2>
<p>I want to be on some next-level shit right here. Let's buy young artists while we can still afford them, even if we don't install for another 5 years. Remember: when your taxi driver gives you a hot tip on a stock, it's time to sell that stock. Anything we're seeing in a shopping mall HAS TO GO. We need one and only one big flagship artist, like a Jeff Koons or a Richard Serra or maybe even an Anish Kapoor, in the $5M range, but for the most part, there's going to be no benefit to making a collection of the same old bullshit that you can see anywhere else.</p>
<h2 id="a-lot-of-this-needs-to-be-administration-stuff-for-now">A lot of this needs to be administration stuff for now</h2>
<p>We need to really study the 1% for arts rule, and make some contacts about institutional collections to see if we can share resources. Going back to the timeline question, basically we need to know how much money we can spend and when we can spend it.</p>
