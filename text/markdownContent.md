# About This Document

These sun studies were produced by Studio F Minus to predict how the sun reflecting off of the reflective sclupture might affect motorists. This study will help determine the final position and orientation for the United Nations Peacekeepers Monument in Peterborough Ontario.

This document and accompanying video contain all of the data produced from this study.

# Methodology

SFM took two approaches to determining the effect of the sun.

 1. To study the movements of the sun and its position relative to the sculptures, SFM used an online computation path of the sun for the location at https://www.suncalc.org/ 
 SunCalc shows the movement of the sun and sunlight-phase for a certain day at a certain place. It also includes important information about the sunrise, sunset and also the culmination point of the sun.
 We used this data to calculate the angle at which the sun  would hit the sculpture, and then the angle at which the sun would bounce off.
 By seeing the _altitude_ of the sun, we were able to determing how far the reflected sunbeams would have to travel down before they passed through the eye level of a motorist.

 2. Using this information, we made combined calculations from the sun angle charts to create a physical model. We mounted a GoPro camera atop a scale-model car, and set it through the physical model to get a "hands-on" sense of what the experience would be. The video entries have all been attached to this document.

We used both approaches to accurately measure the reflection of the sun at nine different times:
 * During the 8:45am morning commuter rush in the fall/spring
 * When the sun is at its highest point in the fall/spring
 * During the 5:45pm evening commuter rush in the fall/spring
 * During the 8:45am morning commuter rush in the summer (June 21)
 * When the sun is at its highest point in the summer (June 21)
 * During the 5:45pm evening commuter rush in summer (June 21)
 * During the 8:45am morning commuter rush in the winter (December 21)
 * When the sun is at its highest point in the winter (December 21)
 * During the mid-afternoon in the winter (December 21. Note that by the evening commuter rush, the sun has already set.)

In each of these set-ups, we studied the effect the sun would have with the sculpture in its original, proposed position (mirror surfaces perpendicular to Charlotte Street) and a possible variation, where the mirror surfaces were parallel to Charlotte Street.

 # Assumptions

 In all of our studies, we did not consider any surrounding trees or buildings to block the sun.

 We did not account for cloud cover.

 So each study considers only an unobstructed line between the sun and the sculpture.

 All of our studies assume the sculpture is set 10 ft back from the curb.



# Results

Our calculations based on SunCalc show that reflected glare from the sculptures should land on the street only during winter evenings.

While creating these studies, we also considered similar glare and reflection effects which occur on other structures with mirrored surfaces. When we looked around and saw how many mirror-glass skyscrapers and lowrises are on a typical streetscape, our concern for glare caused by a single 14-foot tall sculpture was considerably lightened. In short: mirrored surfaces are everywhere on our streets, and don't seem to cause much safety concerns.


# Recommendations

**SFM encourages representatives from the City of Peterborough to review this data and draw their own conclusions about the placement of the artwork.** 

However, SFM submits the following for consideration:

Any glare produced in the Winter evenings should be mitigated by the fact that the sun tends to be more muted and hazy in these winter hours. I would suggest that glare from snow during the day would likely be much more powerful than any glare produced by the sculpture.

For aesthetic reasons, SFM has a **strong preference** to keep the sculpture in its original orientation, with the mirrors running parallel to Charlotte Street. This preserves the presence of the sculpture as a "gateway" to the site, rather than  a barrier.

To alleviate any remaining concerns, SFM would recommend that the easiest adjustment to make to the sculpture would be to move it back slightly from the curb. It is worth noting that, during mid-days in summer, when the sun is at its most intense, is also when the high angle of the sun means that glare is cast relatively close to the foot of the scupture, as opposed to thrown across the street.
