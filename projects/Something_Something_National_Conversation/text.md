# Something Something National Conversation (in 2 characters or less)
<hr>
2016
First exhibited at Angell Gallery, Toronto

### Two clouds move towards each other and collide in a ring of light. They break into nothingness. The phenomenon repeats every 12 seconds. 

In Something Something National Conversation (In 2 Characters Or Less), two clouds of water vapour emerge from holes in opposite gallery walls and float toward each other. They collide and dissipate into nothingness, a phenomenon that repeats in perpetuity. The artwork is simultaneously a spectacle, and an over-elaborate exercise in futility.

This large-scale installation, occupying the entire main gallery space and generating over 3000 litres of water vapour per hour, is the dramatic and conceptual centrepiece of the exhibition, tapping into a sense of powerlessness and puzzlement over the state of our current public discourse.
